A restore after this action should result in the correct ordering of messages as well as clearing up duplicates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Motorola Phone Use\u00a0<\/strong>There are two variants of this problem:\n<ol>\n<li><strong>All the restored messages get the time of restore.<\/strong>\u00a0These phones basically do not accept the time stamp supplied when restoring; they store the supplied time stamp internally but use the time of restore to display to the user. This problem was fixed in v4.4 of the app. If you are still having this problem, please make sure you are running the latest version of the app then delete your messages and restore again. If you are still experiencing this problem then please let us know by clicking the &#8220;Send Feedback&#8221; button in the footer below.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The sent messages get the correct time, but the received messages are off by a few hours<\/strong>. This is also the result of messages getting grouped incorrectly in conversations, with a lot of sent messages appearing together and then a lot of received ones appearing later.This problem is caused by the phone either not storing the correct time zone information, or by adjusting the time zone when displaying to the user. The app has an option to adjust the time zone in the time stamps when viewing or restoring messages.\n<p>Open the preferences screen and then check the appropriate boxes under the \u201cADJUST TIME ZONE\u201d section. You\u2019ll need to delete your existing messages from the phone and perform a Restore again.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes this problem also occurs if you have an app like \u201cSMS Time Fix&#8221; that adjusts the time stamp on messages after they arrive. If this is the case, please disable the other app to confirm whether or not the issue is still occurring.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class='ewd-ufaq-faq-custom-fields'>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class='ewd-ufaq-permalink'>\n\t\n\t<a href='https:\/\/www.synctech.com.au\/faqs\/after-restoring-my-sms-messages-are-now-in-the-wrong-order-have-incorrect-times-or-are-duplicated-why\/'>\n\t\t\n\t\tPermalink\t\t\t\n\t<\/a>\n\n<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class='ewd-ufaq-back-to-top'>\n\t\n\t<a class='ewd-ufaq-back-to-top-link'>\n\t\tBack to Top\t<\/a>\n\n<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A After restoring, my SMS messages are now in the wrong order, have incorrect times, or are duplicated.
