I was using  https://synctech.com.au/view-backup/ to read my sms backups on my local machine.
To go completely, local I used httrack to mirror a copy of synctech's code onto my local machine
so I can read the messages even with no internet access.  This is all synctech code.

I did make one small change to sort the contacts by descending message count, so that I see
the contacts that I talk to the most at the top.
