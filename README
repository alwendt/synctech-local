Synctech SMS Backup Viewer (offline mirror)

I was using https://synctech.com.au/view-backup/
 to read my SMS backups on my local machine.
To go completely local, I used HTTrack to mirror a copy of Synctech’s site so I can read messages even with no internet access.
This is all Synctech code.

I added an option to sort contacts by descending message count, so the people I text the most appear at the top.

Quick start
# 1) Install Python 3 (see below if you don't have it)
# 2) Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/alwendt/synctech-local.git
cd synctech-local/www.synctech.com.au

# 3) Serve locally (port 8000)
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

# 4) Open in your browser
# (either of these usually works depending on the mirror layout)
http://localhost:8000/view-backup/
# or
http://localhost:8000/view-backup/index.html


Prerequisites

Git

Python 3.7+ (for the built-in simple HTTP server)

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install -y python3

macOS (Homebrew): brew install python

Windows: install from https://www.python.org/downloads/
 or use WSL

No other dependencies are required.

Optional: helper script

If you prefer a one-liner script (Linux/macOS), save this as serve.sh in the repo root:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

DIR="$HOME/gits/synctech-local/www.synctech.com.au"
PORT=8000

cd "$DIR" || { echo "Directory not found: $DIR"; exit 1; }
python3 -m http.server "$PORT" --bind 127.0.0.1 &
SERVER_PID=$!

echo "Started server on http://localhost:$PORT (pid $SERVER_PID)"
trap 'kill "$SERVER_PID" 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
wait "$SERVER_PID"


Make it executable with chmod +x serve.sh, then run ./serve.sh.

Shell tip: ~ expands only when unquoted. Use "$HOME/…" (recommended) or unquoted ~/….
cd "~/gits/…" # ❌ will fail; cd "$HOME/gits/…" # ✅ will work.

Directory layout

www.synctech.com.au/ — HTTrack mirror of Synctech’s site.

view-backup/ — the SMS viewer.

Any local tweaks (like the “most messages first” sort) live in the mirrored files.

Credits

Original viewer: Synctech — this repo is just a local mirror for offline use.

Local change: added “Most messages first” sorting option for contacts.
